# AudioForge

AudioForge is an audio analysis toolkit that combines signal processing and machine learning techniques to extract, visualize, and analyze acoustic properties of audio recordings.

## Features

- **Waveform and Spectrogram Visualization**: Generate clear visualizations of audio signals in time and frequency domains
- **Acoustic Feature Extraction**: Extract MFCC, spectral centroid, zero-crossing rate, and other relevant features
- **Audio Classification**: Implement machine learning models to classify audio based on extracted features

## Background

This project draws on my background in computational linguistics and phonetics research, applying similar techniques used in my Master's thesis on Turkish vowel spaces to general audio analysis.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
